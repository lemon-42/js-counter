# Javascript Counter

The purpose of this repo is, for me, to learn `Javascript`.

I do a simply counter in `Javascript`. It's not amazing for now, but i learn quite something.

I use :

```javascript
let myAge = 25

myAge.addEventListener()

document.querySelector()

if (myAge > 25) {
    // My code here
}
```

First I learn quite a bit about the syntax in `Javascript`. I already knew quite a few thing about variable and if/else condition. But never knew the `querySelector()` thing. Is it use to get the element of a specific ID in the `HTML`. Next, is the `addEventListener()` that help me to add and create an event in my code.
